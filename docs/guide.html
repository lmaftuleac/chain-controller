              Schnapps is a library that allows to connect service methods - named handlers, in a chain-like structure.
              The bundle acts as a pipeline, where each handler's output serves as input to the next handler. The bundle can be reused or extended.
              It can be used with <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, <a href="https://hapi.dev/">Hapi</a>, or with any
              other framework that's based on request-response cycle.
            </div>
            <div class="pb-2">
              <zero-md src="snippets/basics/first-example.md"></zero-md>
            </div>
            <div class="pb-2">
              A <strong>handler</strong> is a function, similar to Express's middleware, it accepts four parameters : 
              <code>request</code>, <code>response</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>errorCallback</code>, <code>data</code>. The
              fourth parameter is the input data passed by the previous handler.
              The main difference however is that Schnapp's handlers use <code>next()</code> to pass data the next handler, 
              and <code>errorCallback()</code> for throwing errors. While Express uses <code>next()</code> to pass controll, 
              or to throw an error if any input data is provided (i.e. <code>next(error)</code>). 
              This is a major difference, and should not be confused when working with Schnapps.
            </div>
            <div class="pb-2">
              <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code> objects depend on the framework used. Schnapps does not interact
              whith those objects, it passes them as input to its handlers. Therefore if Schnapps is connected to Hapi, 
              each hanlder will receive <code>request</code> and <code>h</code> as first and second parameter respectively.
            </div>
            <h4 class="display-5 py-5" id="example">Example</h4>
            <div class="pb-2">
              Let's assume we want to build a JWT authentication mechanism for our API, having three access roles:
              <code>USER</code>,
              <code>MANAGER</code>, <code>ADMIN</code>. We'll start by breaking down our authentication flow into steps, for
              each step we'll write a handler
              function. Think of a handler function as service method, where each method is responsible for a specific task:
              <ol class="py-2">
                <li>First we need to parse our request object and substract our Bearer Token</li>
                <li>Then we'll try to decode the token and substract <code>userId</code> and <code>role</code></li>
                <li>And last, we need to check wether the user is allowed to access the route, by checking its <code>role</code></li>
              </ol>
      
              For each step we'll create a handler - keeping in mind that the output of each handler serves as input to the
              next handler.
            </div>
            <div class="pb-2">
              <zero-md src="snippets/basics/create-handlers.md"></zero-md>
            </div>
            <div class="pb-2">
              Now let's connect them all together
            </div>
            <div class="pb-2">
              <zero-md src="snippets/basics/create-controller.md"></zero-md>
            </div>
            <div class="pb-2">
              In this example we have connected all handlers into a single controller. But it's not always in handy to write
              all
              those
              handlers for every route a user can access. Let's split our controller into reusable parts so whenever we need a
              secured route we could simply "extend"
              our authentication controller.
            </div>
            <div class="pb-2">
              <zero-md src="snippets/basics/split-controller.md"></zero-md>
            </div>
            <div class="pb-2">
              Note that a constructor function accepts anoter controller or handler function as input. In fact, it
              accepts
              any number of controllers and handlers. The resutling controller will inherit all handlers in the same order as
              they
              where declared in the constructor function.
            </div>
            <div class="pb-2">
              Now let's extend our authentication flow, so we can re-use it in our app

            <div class="pb-2">
              And for the final part, let's connect our controllers to the framework

              There are many cases where the flow is conditioned by the input data. Let's say we are building a community platform,
              where each user can refer new users and receive bonus points. Besides users, we have affiliate parteners who can
              also refer users and receive a commission. Therefore, in our flow we'll have two conditions : 
              <ol>
                <li>if the registering user is using a referrerId. </li>
                <li>if the user did provide a referrerId - the condition will be based on the role of the referrer : simple 
              users receive bonus ponints, parteners receive commissions.</li>

              Let's replicate the same flow using Schnapps. We'll start by defining each block as a separate controller.

            <div class="pb-2">
              Stores are temporary data holders. Think of a store as temporary data attachet to the request object - like a
              session. As
              long as the request-responce cycle is in progress you can access the stored data. Once the cycle is over, the
              data is disposed
              along with the request object.
            </div>
            <div class="pb-2"><strong>Session Store</strong> - extends request object with a <code>session</code> object and a
              <code>setSession()</code> method </div>
            <div class="pb-2">
              <zero-md src="snippets/stores/ex1.md"></zero-md>

            <div class="pb-2"><strong>Shared Store</strong> - Similar to session store it extends request object with a
              <code>shared</code> object and a <code>setShared()</code> method.
              Altho it has the same structure as the session store, its purpose is to store, share and aggregate data between
              handlers. For example we need to create a route in which we return detailed information about a user, alog with
              its current balance. Assuming that we already have a service that given a <code>userId</code> will return user's details,
              and a similar service which returns user's balance. Let's create a controller that re-uses those services
            </div>

          <div class="pb-4">
            <div class="pb-2">
              As mentioned in the first example - <code>end()</code> and <code>catch()</code> are optional for any controller
              and this is true - since we have access to response object in any handler (altho for a cleaner code we do
              recomend using
              <code>.end()</code> for handling responses). What if we don't want to handle errors on each controller ? The
              solution is
              really simple with Schnapps - we just need to define a global error handler. This way, controllers which do not
              have an
              explicit error handler defined will fallback to global error handler.
