    <div class="pb-4">
      <div class="pb-2">
        Schnapps is a library that allows to connect services in a chain-like structure. The chain bundle can be
        reused or extended.
        It can be used with Express, Hapi, or with any other framework that's based on request-response cycle.
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        <zero-md src="snippets/basics/first-example.md"></zero-md>
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        Let's assume we want to build a JWT authentication mechanism for our API, having three access roles:
        <code>USER</code>,
        <code>MANAGER</code>, <code>ADMIN</code>. We'll start by breaking down our authentication flow into steps, for
        each step we'll write a handler
        function. Think of a handler function as service method, where each method is responsible for a specific task:
        <ol class="py-2">
          <li>First we need to parse our request object and substract our Bearer Token</li>
          <li>Then we'll try to decode the token and substract <code>userId</code> and <code>role</code></li>
          <li>And last, we need to check wether the user is allowed to access the route, by checking its <code>role</code></li>
        </ol>

        For each step we'll create a handler - keeping in mind that the output of each handler serves as input to the
        next handler.
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        <zero-md src="snippets/basics/create-handlers.md"></zero-md>
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        Now let's connect them all together
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        <zero-md src="snippets/basics/create-controller.md"></zero-md>
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        In this example we have connected all handlers into a single controller. But it's not always in handy to write
        all
        those
        handlers for every route a user can access. Let's split our controller into reusable parts so whenever we need a
        secured route we could simply "extend"
        our authentication controller.
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        <zero-md src="snippets/basics/split-controller.md"></zero-md>
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        Note that a constructor function accepts anoter controller or handler function as input parameters. In fact, it
        accepts
        any number of controllers and handlers. The resutling controller will inherit all handlers in the same order as
        they
        where declared in the constructor function.
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        Now let's extend our authentication flow, so we can re-use it in our app

        And for the final part, let's connect our controllers to the framework

    <h4 class="display-5 pb-4">Non-linear flows</h4>
    <div class="pb-4">
      <!-- <div class="pb-2">
        There are many cases where the flow is conditioned by the input data. Let's say we are building a community platform,
        where each user can refer new users and receive bonus points. Besides users, we have affiliate parteners who can
        also refer users and receive a commission. Therefore, in our flow we'll have two conditions : 
        <ol>
          <li>if the registering user is using a referrerId. </li>
          <li>if the user did provide a referrerId - the condition will be based on the role of the referrer : simple 
        users receive bonus ponints, parteners receive commissions.</li>
        </ol>

        has
        provided a referrer id or not. The second condition will be based on the role of the referrer : simple
        users receive bonus ponints, parteners receive commissions, as in the diagram below:

        We can use <code>next()</code> to pass another controller object like so:
        <code>next(controller, {someInptData});</code>.
        Let's replicate the same flow using Schnapps. We'll start by defining each block as a separate controller.

    <h4 class="display-5 pb-4">Using Stores</h4>
    <div class="pb-4">

      <div class="pb-2">
        Stores are temporary data holders. Think of a store as temporary data attachet to the request object - like a
        session. As
        long as the request-responce cycle is in progress you can access the stored data. Once the cycle is over, the
        data is disposed
        along with the request object.
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2"><strong>Session Store</strong> - extends request object with a <code>session</code> object and a
        <code>setSession()</code> method </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        <zero-md src="snippets/stores/ex1.md"></zero-md>
      </div>

      <div class="pb-2"><strong>Shared Store</strong> - Similar to session store it extends request object with a
        <code>shared</code> object and a <code>setShared()</code> method.
        Altho it has the same structure as the session store, its purpose is to store, share and aggregate data between
        handlers. For example we need to create a route in which we return detailed information about a user, alog with
        its current balance. Assuming that we already have a service that given a <code>userId</code> will return user's details,
        and a similar service which returns user's balance. Let's create a controller that re-uses those services
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        <zero-md src="snippets/stores/ex2.md"></zero-md>
      </div>
    </div>


    <h4 class="display-5 pb-4">Global error handler</h4>
    <div class="pb-4">
      <div class="pb-2">
        As mentioned in the first example - <code>end()</code> and <code>catch()</code> are optional for any controller
        and this is true - since we have access to response object in any handler (altho for a cleaner code we do
        recomend using
        <code>.end()</code> for handling responses). What if we don't want to handle errors on each controller ? The
        solution is
        really simple with Schnapps - we just need to define a global error handler. This way, controllers which do not
        have an
        explicit error handler defined will fallback to global error handler.
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        <zero-md src="snippets/error/global-error-handler.md"></zero-md>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4 class="display-5 pb-4">More cool stuff</h4>
    <div class="pb-4">
      <div class="pb-2">
        Use controller as a promise. Not that when a controller is called as promise, it will bypass <code>.end()</code>
        and
        <code>.catch()</code>
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        <zero-md src="snippets/cool-stuff/promise.md"></zero-md>
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        Or convert it to an Express.js middleware. Note that when a controller is called as middleware, it will bypass
        <code>.end()</code> and
        <code>.catch()</code>
      </div>
      <div class="pb-2">
        <zero-md src="snippets/cool-stuff/middleware.md"></zero-md>
      </div>
